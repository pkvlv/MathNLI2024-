Criteria for our NLI seed pairs
  (suggested by Valeria)
  1. Both premisse and hypothesis should be full, grammatical sentences with no typos.
  2. We aim for uncontroversial inference, as much as possible.
  3. We treat mathematical concepts as much as possible as black-boxes. (Inference shouldn't depend on mathematical knowledge.)
  4. We shouldn't have ambiguity of words, e.g. "stack" as a math concept mixed up with "stack of papers"
  5. We should not have "dangling references" or coreferences, we aim for simple semantics.
  6. We should not deal with temporal or spatial reasoning.
